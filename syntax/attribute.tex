\section{Attribute Grammars}

\subsection{Left-Right attributes}
Given a rule of type $A_0 \rarr A_1A_2\ldots$

\begin{description}
    \item[Left attribute] $\sigma_0 = f(\ldots)$ associated to $A_0$
    \item[Right attribute] $\delta_i = f(\ldots), i \ge 1$, associated to $A_i$
\end{description}

An attribute cannot be both left and right.

\subsection{Dependence Graph}

Given a rule $p$, its dependence graph $dep_p$ is a directed graph:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nodes are the attributes
    \item There is an arc from every argument to the result
    \item Left attributes are on the left, right to the right
\end{itemize}

If the dependence graph is acyclic there exists a set of attribute values. A grammar is \textbf{loop-free} if the dependence graph is always acyclic.

\subsection{Depth-First visit}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start from the root
    \item Visit the child nodes in some specified order
    \item Foreach subtree $t_N$ rooted at node $N$ :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Before visiting $t_N$ compute the right attributes of $N$ and pass them down to the visit
        \item After visiting $t_N$ compute the left attributes using the return value of the visit
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Depth-First Visit Conditions (one-sweep)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The graph $dep_p$ has no circuit
    \item In $dep_p$ there exists no path from a left attribute to a right attribute of the same node
    \item In $dep_p$ there exists no arc from a left attribute of the father to a right attribute of any child
    \item There are no circuits in $sibl_p$ graph
\end{itemize}

There is an arc $D_i \rarr D_j$ in $sibl_p$ iff in $dep_p$ there is an arc $\alpha_i \rarr \beta_j$ with $\alpha_i \in \text{attr}(D_i)$ and $\beta_j \in \text{attr}(D_j)$.

\subsection{One-Sweep condition}

\begin{itemize}
  \item NO circular dependences
  \item Right attributes depend only on right ones in the parent node
  \item Left attributes depend only on attributes (both right and left) in the siblings
\end{itemize}

\subsection{One-Sweep Evaluator}
There is a procedure for each nonterminal, its parameters are the subtree rooted at the nonterminal and the right attributes of the root; it visits the subtree and returns the left attributes of the root.

For the rule $p: D_0 \rarr D_1D_2\ldots D_r$
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a Topological Order of Siblings $TOS$ compatible with $sibl_p$
    \item For each symbol $D_i, i>0$ choose a topological order of the right attributes $TOR$
    \item Choose a topological order of the left attributes of $D_0$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Condition L}
Used to embed semantic evaluator inside recursive descent syntax parser.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support syntax is of type LL(k)
    \item Depth-First Visit Conditions
    \item The natural order ($D_1, D_2, \ldots$) is a valid TOS is $sibl_p$ (i.e. no arc $D_j\rarr D_i$ with $j>i$)
\end{itemize}
